# Monikers

This is a web-based implementation of the party game Monikers, built with Next.js and TypeScript.

## Description

Monikers is a fun and hilarious party game where players try to guess the names of people, characters, and other pop culture references on cards. The game is played in three rounds, with the same set of cards used in each round. The rules for what you can say to get your team to guess the card change each round, making it progressively more challenging and funny.

This project is a digital version of the game, allowing you to play with friends in person without needing physical cards.

## Features

-   **Multiple Game Levels:** Includes different card decks for varying difficulty.
-   **Round-based Gameplay:** Supports the classic three-round structure of Monikers.
-   **Interactive UI:** Components for game setup, card selection, gameplay, and scoring.
-   **Sound Effects:** Includes sounds for game events.
